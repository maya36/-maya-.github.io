    <h2>Exciting Advances in Digital Health</h2>
    <p>
      Digital health and medical technologies are transforming the way we approach healthcare. From wearable devices that monitor your heart rate to apps that help you manage chronic conditions, technology is putting control back into the hands of patients.
    </p>
    <h3>Why Digital Health Matters</h3>
    <p>
      Devices like smartwatches, fitness trackers, and blood glucose monitors are empowering individuals to stay proactive about their health. These tools provide real-time data that can be shared with healthcare providers, improving communication and outcomes.
